    "The most well-known Python library for visualizations is `matplotlib`, which was developed as a free, open-source response to Matlab. `matplotlib` is very powerful and can create static visualizations that cannot be easily created with other tools. You can see some of these complex visualizations in the [Matplotlib's Gallery](https://matplotlib.org/gallery.html). However, because `matplotlib` provides a great level of control about every aspect of a visualization, it is not idealf for fast data exploration. Therefore, we will also discuss `seaborn` and `plotly express` (in separate notebooks).\n",
